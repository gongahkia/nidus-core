#### Explanation

* When users deposit Assets (swapped for XSGD) with us, user will be issued an LP token (represents the percentage ownership of the total pool) if they choose to lend it
* At any time users can do either of the following
    1. Users can exchange their LP token at anytime to retrieve XSGD based on % accruement + principal amount +  **NOTE** there are withdrawal fees involved (cashing out)
    2. Users can exchange their LP token to borrow XSGD from us to use to continue accrueing their % accruement + **NOTE** we earn interest off this borrowing (borrowing)
* LPs are backed by RWAs (Annuity and Endowments)
