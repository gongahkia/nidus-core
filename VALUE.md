## Treehouse's value prop

* Currently Treehouse is still very much focused on actual CryproCurrencies
* Framented on-chain interest rates make it very difficult to estimate the base rate, which makes it different to determine the optimal position any FinBro should adopt
* Treehouse offers
  * More stable, higher interests rates 
  * Aggregates across strategies and determines the risk-free interest rate for a particular asset

## BlackBeard's value prop

* Current DeFi platforms have varying interest rates for different StableCoins (Fragmented on-chain interest rates)
* BlackBeard would aim to fill the same niche Treehouse does for the StableCoin market 
  * More stable, higher interests rates 
  * Aggregates across strategies and determines the risk-free interest rate for a particular asset
